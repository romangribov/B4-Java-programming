    create a program to guess the secret number.
    flow will be as follows:
    define the secret number, hard coded
    ask the user to guess a number
    based on the guess tell them a message:

        if they guess higher than the number:
          too high

        if they guess lower than the number:
          too low

        if they guess the number:
          you guessed correctly
